# Group Chatting Application

This is a group chatting application developed using Flutter and Firebase firestore. User Authentication is handled by Firebase Auth. User can create new groups, search for existing groups and chat within the groups.

# Introduction

- The life of a college student is always difficult, regardless of whether they are in a traditional college or take classes online. A student's success cannot be measured by how hard they work, but rather by how smart they work, and to do that they need to have access to the right resources. 
- With the advancement of digital technology, more and more applications are being developed to make studying easier and more enjoyable. 
- Keeping this as the main purpose of our project, we will be designing an application software similar to a communication platform, open for all the students where they can join groups and clear their doubts.
